# podcastClipper

Podcast Clipper is a Windows program that allows users to save memorable podcast moments without the hassle of opening an audio editor,
importing the audio file and remembering the exact time a clip starts and ends.  Users can create audio clips while listening to a
podcastby pressing a button which will save the current time stamp and prompt the user to enter the name and description of the clip,
as well as the number of previous minutes of audio to save as a new MP3 file.  Written in Python and powered by the Qt framework, Podcast
Clipper proves a GUI that enables users to easily view podcast subscriptions and download the latest episodes.  Subscribe to podcasts by
entering RSS feeds or import subscriptions by using an XML/OPML file.
